# Light Show []
`The system will likely use a video setup instead of static photos. Allows to capture moving vehicles, i.e. Emergency vehicles & Buses`
1. Better Lights Inc.
     - For incoming vehicles (emergency vehicles, buses) will force it so that the traffic lights passes them, & also determines how close to the traffic light
2. Old Face Reg.
     - uses face recognition to allow, & keeps the light on as ppl are approaching.
     - makes the traffic light change if there are no cars
3. Uses cloud Data
     - Buzzes a melody when there is a lightning alert, uses humidity to predict rain, and potential difference to see if lightning is gonna strike
     - If lightning is detected, output 'Lightning incoming! Seek Shelter now!'
     - LCD also displays date & time 
4. Data Collection
	- Using the images that the camera sees, it will tabulate the amount of vehicles on the road & add them to a data base
	- Allows for tracking of roadways, at certain points of time, also allows for there to be better calibration between traffic lights
	- It then uploads the data into the cloud to be stored, can have like local backup if needed
